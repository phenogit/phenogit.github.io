## Non-Competitive Bidding

### Meta Rules

    My agreements are that in a constructive auction artificial calls above 3N are never choice of strains unless slam is totally out of the question.
    Below 3N, no slam tries unless a 9-card major suit fit has been established.
    Above 3N, no choice of games cue-bids.
    Not a control-bidding style. Partner will tend to cue-bid in the suit where he needs help.
    We use the 4 level to see if we have the strength for slam.
    If we decide that we do, then we can use RKC if we think keycards are the issue, asking bids if we think controls are the issue, or simply invite if we think a bit more power might be needed.
    Our general style is to make the Q-bid which leaves partner last train wriggle room unless we have the sort of hand which doesn't want to hear that last train bid since we wouldn't know what to do over it. Or, as on this hand, North can afford to shut out the last train call since he is planning on making another move anyway. Thus, when an unlimited hand chooses to make the Q-bid which shuts out the last train call, the inference is that he probably isn't minimal for his Q-bid.
    4 of a previously bid major is always an offer to play if that is at all possible.
    When 4X other than 4NT is the RKC call, 4NT is the substitute.
         if 4NT is a double jump it is exclusion, if it is a single jump it is a splinter, and if it is a non-jump it is a Q-bid.

        1) 3/4 seat, 18+ if balanced
        1D: Artificial,
            1) unpassed hand: 0-8
            2) passed hand: 0-7
            1H: Forcing, 4+ hearts, but with only 4 hearts you would be expected to have longer minor

            We have recently modified our entire structure so all of responder's lower positive responses are transfers to the next higher strain (with 1S showing the 9-14 balanced hand). This obviously hurts us when responder has a heart positive since he has to start with 2D, but we can live with that.

## Competitive Bidding

### Meta Rules

    General agreements are that 2N in competition is always takeout unless specifically defined otherwise.
    When in a game force, doubles by either partner are penalties.
    Your agreements regarding pass and redouble after an artificial call such as 2NT is doubled is that pass is an offer to play while redouble is never business -- partner may not pass.
    After a penalty pass, all future doubles by your side are penalties
    At lower levels there is some argument for double followed by bidding a suit, showing a stronger hand than an immediate overcall. At high levels, this does not make sense. The primary goal is to find your best strain, and you don't have much room to maneuver. Double must be reserved for hands which are looking for the right strain, while overcalls must be reserved for hands where the overcalled suit is likely to be the best strain. Strength should not be an issue.
    The concept of the slower auction emphasizing the higher suit in scrambling auctions is a common concept which comes up quite often.
    Takeout double style is strongly oriented towards equal-level conversion.
    If you X and partner bids 1D or 2D, a 2H call by you would show no extra strength and would be non-forcing.
    Consequently, partner will assume you don't have 4 spades if you overcall 1H.
    For us, double followed by a new suit doesn't necessarily show a powerhouse even if we are raising the level, since with just a 1-suiter we will overcall unless we have the rare hand which is too strong to risk an overcall.
    Michaels is strictly 5-5 or better.
    A non-jump 2N (2N over 2C is considered a jump) in competition or in response to a double is virtually never natural -- except in response to a negative double, as that needs to be natural.
    As for the meaning of the 2N call, if game is "out of the picture" or if responder is severely limited, then scrambling has priority.
    Otherwise, Lebensohl has priority.
    Once you go beyond the RKC call, RKC is no longer available
    Cue bids aren't necessarily control showing, especially when there is not much room to maneuver. A cue bid simply shows some slam interest.
    Your general agreements are that when you have a minor-suit fit and a 4-4 major-suit fit is possible, then 4 of a major is an offer to play even if the suit hasn't been previously bid.
    Our pass over the lead directing double is well-defined. In general, unless there is a definition for a specific auction, the pass denies a stopper in the doubled suit if below 3NT and denies a control in the doubled suit above 3N. Immediate calls are the bid we would have made without the double, but in addition they show a stopper or a control.
    After the pass, the person who has made the artificial call will redouble 95% of the time. This redouble is a repeat of the artificial call, and our auction will continue as if there were no double, except that we have the added knowledge about whatever the pass showed. Thus, the double doesn't change the meanings of our constructive sequences one iota.
    We do not bid 4NT naturally on non-notrump auctions.
    5NT is always pick a slam unless it is otherwise specifically defined.
        Common specific definitions
        If it is part of our RKC followup (queen ask or king ask sequences)
        If spades are trumps and 5NT is a double jump, it is GSF
        If a definite grand slam try has been made, 5NT may be just showing interest but not being able to bid the grand. This is most common when clubs are trumps -- 5NT is then a last train type of call.
    Equal-level conversion
    Our agreement for forcing pass is that when game is bid under fire (i.e. had to be bid to outbid an enemy call) as opposed to voluntarily then we are not in a force unless we have previously shown game-forcing values.
    When 3N is doubled
        XX by either partner shows doubt
        If X of 3N is calling for a specific lead, the focus is on that suit for the decision between pass and XX.
        Pass would show something in the suit, partner can then XX to still show doubt
    When an opening 1NT or a 1NT overcall is doubled for penalties, your runout agreements are as follows:
    By the partner of the 1NT bidder:
    Redouble: Forces 2♣. Usually a 1-suiter in clubs, diamonds, or hearts. Redouble can also be used as a prelude to show some strong 2-suiters.
    2♣, 2♦, or 2♥: Shows that suit and a higher suit.
    Higher suit bids: To play
    Pass: Non-committal. The 1NT bidder may run or pass it out at his discretion.
    By the 1NT bidder, the meanings are reversed. Suit bids are natural 1-suiters. Redouble shows 2 suits.

    E.g.
        1N!-(2C@)-P-(2D#);
        2N -(X  )
            !: 10-12
            @: Majors
            #: Asking for better major

    Transfer advances when partner overcalls and the next hand passes or doubles.
    Transfer range starts with the cue bid and ends 1 under the overcaller's suit.
    Notrump bids are natural.

    Transfer Response Over X of 1D Opener
    1D-(X)-??
        XX: Shows hearts
        1H: Shows spades

        If fourth seat bids something, opener makes a support double with 3-card support, raises with 4-card support.
        If fourth seat passes, opener bids 1 of responder's suit with 3-card support, with other bids meaning the same as if responder had bid 1 of his major.
        In particular, 2 of responder's major doesn't show anything except 4-card support.

    Cont'd
    1D-(X)-1H-(P);
    ??
        1S: Show 3-card spade support.
        Other bids are exactly as if partner had bid a natural 1S.

    Transfer to 3N Over 1 Major Overcall of 1D Opener
    The transfer call is always 3C.

    Forcing pass doesn't show extra strength.
    All it shows is more of an offensive orentation.

    Voluntarily and non-premptively jumps to game creates a force.

    Artificial notrump try gets doubles:
        Passing shows partial stopper, then XX by partner would show a little help but not a true partial stopper
        XX woudl normally show a stopper but prefer to have partner play it
        3N shows a full stopper

    Passing lead directing double of 3N shows at least partial stopper.
    XX shows no stopper.
    Avoids running on his own.

    E.g.
          1D-(P)-2N;
      (P)-3N-(X)-??
        P : Partial stopper or better
        XX: No stopper

    Cont'd
            1D-(P)-2N;
        (P)-3N-(X)-P ;
        (P)-??
            XX: Shows not even a partial stopper

    Pass/X Inversion
        Applies when the following conditions are satisfied:
            1) We have opened 1C
            2) We are in a force
            3) Opponents are at the 4 level or higher
        Only one pass/X inversion per auction
        If we have bid a suit, immediate 4NT is RKC and delayed 4NT is regular Blackwood
        If we have not bid a suit, immediate 4NT is regular Blackwood, and delayed 4NT is takeout

    E.g.
        1C-(P)-2C -(2H);
        2S-(P)-4C-(4D);
       -??
            X : Optional, like a normal forcing pass.
            P : This requests partner to double unless he has a hand which would not have sat a penalty double.
               If you aren't planning on passing the double, you have various possible followups depending on the logic of the auction.
               X:
                4S: Offer to play, but not as strong as an immediate 4S call.
                5C: Slam try.
            4H: RKC for clubs.
                Normal responses (even though responder is known to have AK of trumps he still counts them in his response). However, since he is known to have the queen of trumps, he doesn't show that as a queen.
                Instead, he calls the jack of trumps the queen. This way you can determine whether the suit is truly solid.
            4S: To play
            4N: Slam try in clubs. Says nothing about controls.
                (5D)-?
                    P: Normal forcing pass
            5C: To play, no slam interest

    E.g.
        1C-(3S)-??

            P          : The only weak action
            X          : 9+, game forcing
            Other Calls: Natural and positive

    Cont'd

        1C-(3S)-X-(4S);
        ??

            P          : Request partner to double unless he has a hand which would not have sat a penalty double.
                        After he doubles, you can pass if you were making a penalty double or bid something to show a flexible type of offensive hand
            X          : Like a forcing pass, showing interest in declaring but leaving the decision to partner
            Other Calls: Natural and a less flexible type of hand

    Cont'd

        1C-(3S)-X -(4S);
        X -(P )-5H-(P );
        ??

            In addition to 5 of a suit, partner could have bid 4N which would be takeout.
            You would initially assume it would be for the minors, but he might have any 2 suits and be trying to find out which suit you like best.
            If partner has extra strength and wants to make a slam try in hearts, he could bid 4N. The plan would be to pull your hoped-for 5C call to 5H. This low to high pull would logically be a slam try, since if he were looking for a choice of suits he would have either passed 5C or bid 5D giving you a choice of red suits. This plan would not work if you bid 5D, since then his 5H call could simply be a hand which wanted to play in either 5C or 5H.

    Penalty X of 1N puts partnership in force
    Ｅ.g.
        1D-(1N)-X
        follow up
            1D-(1N)-X-2S;
            ??
                X : Penalty
                2N: Both minors, diamond emphasis
                    Possibly both red suits with longer diamond, he pulls 3C to 3D
                3C: Both minors, club emphasis

            1D-(1N)-X-2S;
            P -(P ) -??
                    X : Penalty
                        * Partner pulls to 2N is probably 3 suited takeout
                    2N: Takeout, asking for better minor
                    3C: Natural, non-forcing
                    3D: Natural, non-forcing
                    3H: Natural, non-forcing

    A non-jump to 2N in competition is never natural.
    If game is logically possible, 2N is a relay to 3C assumed to show a weak hand somewhere, while 3-level calls (including a raise) are stronger.
    If game is not logically possible, 2N is takeout presumably for the minors, and 3-level bids are just competitive.

    Pass of a redouble of a takeout double is always penalties, unless both of the following conditions are met:
        1) The opponents are at the 1-level.
        2) The partner of the doubler is in front of the suit doubled.
    Ｅ.g.
        a. (1S)-X-(XX)-Pass is non-committal.
        b. (1S)-P-(P )-X;
           (XX)-Pass is penalties.
        c. (1S)-(P)-(2S)-P;
           (P)- (P)-(XX)-Pass is penalties.

           On hands with 4+ diamonds and short in a major this will often avoid going for a number since 4th seat needs a diamond stack to pass.
        XX: Forces partner to bid 2H, after which you place the contract. This allows you to stop in 2H when you have a long heart suit.

## Modules

    RKC(03/14)
    We always use the cheapest artificial call above 4 of the trump suit for our RKC call.
    4T+1 always being RKC for T provided 4T+1 isn't needed as natural.
    5T+1 being the king ask.
    Void-showing response is permissible only if the RKC was 4T+1 and it is 100% certain from the auction what suit the void is in.
    Even with that, responder may choose to not show the void if he fears it may get us too high.
    Starts at 5T + 1
        0/3
        1/4
        2 without
        2 with
            If responder has 2 with, he zooms to show number of kings at the same time
    RKC bidder may then ask for qeen of trumps (first step) if not known, or he may ask for number of kings (second step or first step if queen known).

    E.g.
    4S RKC, follow-ups other than 5H/6H signoff
        5C: Ask for queen of trumps
        5D: Ask for queen of trumps
        5S: Ask for specific kings
            5S does not promise all keycards, if responder wants to bid grand slam, he bids 6N
            Partner shows kings up the line, showing the lowest king
                Make a bid corresponding to a higher king asks partner to bid 6N if holding that king
        5N: Pick a slam
        6C: Natural offer to play
        6D: Natural offer to play

    2M Game Try
    We play a version of 2-way game tries. 2T+1 = some short suit game or slam try -- next step asks, short suit shown in coded manner. 2T+2 through 2T+4 = long/help suit game tries in coded manner.

    We play this identical structure any time an 8-card major-suit fit is known and we are at or below 2M.

    If opponents make takeout double, play same. We seldom change our methods when the make takeout double.

    If they overcall, system is off. New suits are naturalish help suit game tries, within the context of how much room we have. If they overcall at 3-level, double is penalty. We do not play any kind of maximal doubles. If there is no room we make my favorite kind of game try -- bid game and try to make it.

    Two Card X
    You play this 2-card double when the following conditions are satisfied:
        1) Opponents have bid at the 2-level
        2) Both you and your partner have done something other than pass (but did not open or overcall 1N)
        3) You are not in a force
        4) The double doesn't have another pre-defined meaning (such as support double)
    It shows exactly two cards in opponents' trumps and interest in competing.

    E.g.
        (P )-1D-(X)-1H;

        (2H)-??
            X: Two Card X

            2H: To play, no game interest
            2S: Assumed natural, game-forcing
            2N: Takeout, asking for better minor
            3C: To play
            3D: Some kind of game force
            3N: Natural invite

    E.g.
         1S-(P)-1N-(2H);
        -??
            X : Two card X
                2N: Takeout
            2S: Normal, 6-card spade suit
            2N: Relay to 3C, showing a weak 3 of a minor call
            3C: 5-5 maximum

    E.g.
        1H-(P)-2H-(2S)
            X of 2S by both opener and responder would be 2-card.

    3-level Responsive Alternative
    We use this treatment all the time at the 3-level, when partner has opened the bidding, overcalled, or made a takeout double, and the next hand bids 3C, 3D, or 3H
    E.g.
    (2C!)-2S-(3C)-??
        !: Precision

        X : Relay to next cheapest suit, assumed to be weak somewhere
            But followed by cue bid or 3N shows regular responsive
        3D: Natural and forcing
        3H: Natural and forcing
        3S: Limit raise
        4C: Slam interest, shows nothing about clubs
        4S: What it sounds like, creates force

    4-level Unspecified Major Cue Bid
    When partner's last call is 3S or 3N and:
        1) Neither minor is a possible trump suit:
            4C: Slam try in hearts
            4D: Slam try in spades
        2) Clubs is a possible trump suit:
            4D: Slam try in unspecific major
                4H : No interest in either major or interest in spades but not hearts
                4S : Interest in hearts but not spades
                4N+: Interest in both majors
        3) Diamonds is a possible trump suit:
            4C: Slam try in unspecific major
                4D: Ask for which major

            3H: Sound overcall
            3S: Sound overcall

    High-level Artificial Call Gets Doubled
    With no first or second round control in the doubled strain, next hand passes.
    If the person making the artificial call is still interested he redoubles.
    If the person making the artificial call also has no control, he can hit the brakes and place the contract.
    If the partner of the artificial bidder has a first or second round control of the suit, he simply makes the same bid he would have made had there been no double.
    Direct redouble shows no control but the queen of the suit.

    E.g.
    2C -(P )-2D-(P);
    3N -(P )-4D-(X);
    4N!-(5D)-??
        !: 2 keycards, no queen of trumps, diamond control

    Fit Showing Bids
    If 2 of the 3 following conditions are met
        Partner has shown or implied a 6 card suit (by a 2 level opening or overcall)
        Bidder is a passed hand
        Bid is 4 of a minor
    Else it is natural

    Flexi-Balance vs. 2S
    We use it in the balancing seat when both X and 2N would be takeout.
    X : Shows either -
            1) 3 suited
            2) hearts and clubs
            3) hearts and diamonds, longer diamonds
            2N: Ask if you have diamonds, will always bid this with 4 or 5 diamonds
                3C: Club-heart hand
                3D: Hand containing diamonds
    2N: Shows either -
        1) Minors
        2) Red suits, equal length or longer hearts
        3C
            P : Minors
            3D: Red suits
    The advantage comes when the balancer has hearts and clubs. Picture South's problem playing standard methods (where 2N shows some 2-suiter) if his minors were reversed. If he bids 2N, North will bid 3D with more diamonds than clubs, and the proper 3C will be bypassed. With this structure, the problem is avoided. Responder will not bid 3D in response to a takeout double unless he has a long diamond suit. If his best suit is diamonds he will bid 2N to see if the doubler has diamond tolerance or has the club-heart 2-suiter, and the best strain will usually be found.

## Carding

### Meta Rules

    AK leads at the 5-level and higher:
        A: Asks for attitude (standard)
        K: Asks for count (standard)

#### NT

##### General

    UDCA including discards except for trick 1 where it is standard signals
    Smith echo, high means he likes the opening lead and low means he doesn't
    In middle of hand, T/9 show 0 or 2 higher; other spot card leads are generally attitude
    In the middle of the hand, K asks for upside down count, other honors as for upside down attitude
    If giving count, first played card is upside-down count, if not it is standard count

##### Opening Leads

    9 or higher is considered an honor
    A from AK
    Non-partner's suit
        Rusinow(lower of touching honors with more than a doubleton)
        K is power lead, requesting unblock or standard count
    Partner's suit
        Standard leads
        Standard attitude signals at trick 1 when partner leads your bid suit
    Attitude leads for non-honor cards
    Standard attitude on other honor leads

#### Suit

##### General

    Suit-preference at trick 1
        T/9/8 high side suit
        2/3/4 low side suit
        6/5/7 encouraging
        J     special card which says that partner doesn't have the spot card for the signal
        Make least damaging signal if no suitable card
    UDCA
    Standard current count on later plays in a suit after having given suit-preference
    Standard current count for discard
    Lead of king in the middle of the hand asks for upside-down count
    Splitting honors show 0 or 2 higher
    Opening lead in trumps tend to be suit preference
    We play (as do most expert pairs) than spot card signals in trumps are suit-preference if they mean anything. We do not echo in order to show 3 trumps.
    Shifts in the middle fo the hand are attitude, jack denies, T or 9 = 0 or 2 higher

##### Opening Leads

    Your agreements are that from AK you may lead either the ace or the king.
        You lead the ace when you want an attitude signal. (Standard, not upside down)
        You lead the king when you want a suit-preference signal.
        However, with an AKQ holding if the opening leader wants a suit-preference signal he will lead the queen, which will be more informative.
            When dummy has a singleton or void in the suit led, you revert to suit preference
    Standard honor leads for non-AK.
    Interior sequence
        2nd from interior sequence with 3, 4, or 6-card suit.
        Top of interior with 5-card suit.
    Third from even, smallest from odd, top of a doubleton
    5th best from 7 card suit if there is known length
    From 3 small, high or low, when in doubt - count
    Leads in trump suit is suit preference
