# Carding
## vs NT
### General
    UDCA including discards except for trick 1 where it is standard signals
    Smith echo
    In middle of hand, T/9 show 0 or 2 higher; other spot card leads are generally attitude
    If giving count, first played card is upside-down count, if not it is standard count
### Opening Leads
    A from AK, Rusinow(lower of touching honors with more than a doubleton), K is power lead; _partner's suit does not apply, standard leads_, attitude leads for small card
