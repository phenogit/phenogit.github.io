## Competitive Bidding
### Meta Rules
    Forcing pass doesn't show extra strength.
    All it shows is more of an offensive orentation.

    Voluntarily and non-premptively jumps to game creates a force

    penalty X of 1N puts partnership in force
    e.g.
        1D-(1N)-X
        follow up
            1D-(1N)-X-2S;
            ??
                X : Penalty
                2N: Both minors, diamond emphasis
                    Possibly both red suits with longer diamond, he pulls 3C to 3D
                3C: Both minors, club emphasis

            1D-(1N)-X-2S;
            P -(P ) -??
                    X : Penalty
                        * Partner pulls to 2N is probably 3 suited takeout
                    2N: Takeout, asking for better minor
                    3C: Natural, non-forcing
                    3D: Natural, non-forcing
                    3H: Natural, non-forcing
