## Non-Competitive Bidding

### Meta Rules

    My agreements are that in a constructive auction artificial calls above 3N are never choice of strains unless slam is totally out of the question.
    Below 3N, no slam tries unless a 9-card major suit fit has been established.
    Above 3N, no choice of games cue-bids.
    Not a control-bidding style. Partner will tend to cue-bid in the suit where he needs help.
    We use the 4 level to see if we have the strength for slam.
    If we decide that we do, then we can use RKC if we think keycards are the issue, asking bids if we think controls are the issue, or simply invite if we think a bit more power might be needed.
    Our general style is to make the Q-bid which leaves partner last train wriggle room unless we have the sort of hand which doesn't want to hear that last train bid since we wouldn't know what to do over it. Or, as on this hand, North can afford to shut out the last train call since he is planning on making another move anyway. Thus, when an unlimited hand chooses to make the Q-bid which shuts out the last train call, the inference is that he probably isn't minimal for his Q-bid.
    4 of a previously bid major is always an offer to play if that is at all possible.

                2 way checkback follow up

                        2S: Natural, showing a 5 card spade suit. Natural bidding after that
                            3S: Does not show slam interest, 3 card support and not the worst piece of trash

                        2N: Asks about partner's distribution. You would be able to determine his exact shape without going beyond 3N. After finding his shape, you could either bid 3N or:
                            1) Arrange to sign off at game in any suit
                            2) Arrange to make a moderate slam try in any suit or notrump
                            3) Make a very strong slam try in any suit
                            4) Bid RKC for any suit

## Competitive Bidding
### Meta Rules
    General agreements are that 2N in competition is always takeout unless specifically defined otherwise.
    When in a game force, doubles by either partner are penalties.
    Your agreements regarding pass and redouble after an artificial call such as 2NT is doubled is that pass is an offer to play while redouble is never business -- partner may not pass.
    After a penalty pass, all future doubles by your side are penalties
    At lower levels there is some argument for double followed by bidding a suit, showing a stronger hand than an immediate overcall. At high levels, this does not make sense. The primary goal is to find your best strain, and you don't have much room to maneuver. Double must be reserved for hands which are looking for the right strain, while overcalls must be reserved for hands where the overcalled suit is likely to be the best strain. Strength should not be an issue.

    E.g.
        1N!-(2C@)-P-(2D#);
        2N -(X  )
            !: 10-12
            @: Majors
            #: Asking for better major

    Transfer Response Over X of 1D Opener
    1D-(X)-??
        XX: Shows hearts
        1H: Shows spades
        
        If fourth seat bids something, opener makes a support double with 3-card support, raises with 4-card support. 
        If fourth seat passes, opener bids 1 of responder's suit with 3-card support, with other bids meaning the same as if responder had bid 1 of his major. 
        In particular, 2 of responder's major doesn't show anything except 4-card support.

    Cont'd
    1D-(X)-1H-(P);
   -??
        1S: Show 3-card spade support. 
        Other bids are exactly as if partner had bid a natural 1♠.

    Forcing pass doesn't show extra strength.
    All it shows is more of an offensive orentation.

    Voluntarily and non-premptively jumps to game creates a force.

    Artificial notrump try gets doubles:
        Passing shows partial stopper, then XX by partner would show a little help but not a true partial stopper
        XX woudl normally show a stopper but prefer to have partner play it
        3N shows a full stopper

    Passing lead directing double of 3N shows at least partial stopper.
    XX shows no stopper.
    Avoids running on his own.

    E.g.
          1D-(P)-2N;
      (P)-3N-(X)-??
        P : Partial stopper or better
        XX: No stopper

    Cont'd
            1D-(P)-2N;
        (P)-3N-(X)-P ;
        (P)-??
            XX: Shows not even a partial stopper

    Pass/X Inversion
        Applies when the following conditions are satisfied:
            1) We have opened 1C
            2) We are in a force
            3) Opponents are at the 4 level or higher
        Only one pass/X inversion per auction
        If we have bid a suit, immediate 4NT is RKC and delayed 4NT is regular Blackwood
        If we have not bid a suit, immediate 4NT is regular Blackwood, and delayed 4NT is takeout

    E.g.
        1C-(P)-2C -(2H);
        2S-(P)-4C-(4D);
       -??
            X : Optional, like a normal forcing pass.
            P : This requests partner to double unless he has a hand which would not have sat a penalty double. 
               If you aren't planning on passing the double, you have various possible followups depending on the logic of the auction.
               X:
                4S: Offer to play, but not as strong as an immediate 4S call.
                5C: Slam try.
            4H: RKC for clubs. 
                Normal responses (even though responder is known to have AK of trumps he still counts them in his response). However, since he is known to have the queen of trumps, he doesn't show that as a queen. 
                Instead, he calls the jack of trumps the queen. This way you can determine whether the suit is truly solid.
            4S: To play
            4N: Slam try in clubs. Says nothing about controls.
                (5D)-?
                    P: Normal forcing pass
            5C: To play, no slam interest

    E.g.
        1C-(3S)-??

            P          : The only weak action
            X          : 9+, game forcing
            Other Calls: Natural and positive

    Cont'd

        1C-(3S)-X-(4S);
        ??

            P          : Request partner to double unless he has a hand which would not have sat a penalty double.
                        After he doubles, you can pass if you were making a penalty double or bid something to show a flexible type of offensive hand
            X          : Like a forcing pass, showing interest in declaring but leaving the decision to partner
            Other Calls: Natural and a less flexible type of hand

    Cont'd

        1C-(3S)-X -(4S);
        X -(P )-5H-(P );
        ??

            In addition to 5 of a suit, partner could have bid 4N which would be takeout.
            You would initially assume it would be for the minors, but he might have any 2 suits and be trying to find out which suit you like best.
            If partner has extra strength and wants to make a slam try in hearts, he could bid 4N. The plan would be to pull your hoped-for 5C call to 5H. This low to high pull would logically be a slam try, since if he were looking for a choice of suits he would have either passed 5C or bid 5D giving you a choice of red suits. This plan would not work if you bid 5D, since then his 5H call could simply be a hand which wanted to play in either 5C or 5H.

    Penalty X of 1N puts partnership in force
    Ｅ.g.
        1D-(1N)-X
        follow up
            1D-(1N)-X-2S;
            ??
                X : Penalty
                2N: Both minors, diamond emphasis
                    Possibly both red suits with longer diamond, he pulls 3C to 3D
                3C: Both minors, club emphasis

            1D-(1N)-X-2S;
            P -(P ) -??
                    X : Penalty
                        * Partner pulls to 2N is probably 3 suited takeout
                    2N: Takeout, asking for better minor
                    3C: Natural, non-forcing
                    3D: Natural, non-forcing
                    3H: Natural, non-forcing

    A non-jump to 2N in competition is never natural. 
    If game is logically possible, 2N is a relay to 3C assumed to show a weak hand somewhere, while 3-level calls (including a raise) are stronger. 
    If game is not logically possible, 2N is takeout presumably for the minors, and 3-level bids are just competitive.

    Pass of a redouble of a takeout double is always penalties, unless both of the following conditions are met:
        1) The opponents are at the 1-level.
        2) The partner of the doubler is in front of the suit doubled.
    Ｅ.g.
        a. (1S)-X-(XX)-Pass is non-committal. 
        b. (1S)-P-(P )-X;
           (XX)-Pass is penalties. 
        c. (1S)-(P)-(2S)-P;
           (P)- (P)-(XX)-Pass is penalties.

    CRASH over strong club. 
    The crash bids are X, 1D, and 1N. 1NT would show pointed or rounded suits. Other calls are natural.

    1D-(1S)-X -(P);
    2C-(P )-2S!

        !: 2S cue bid is game forcing as you play

    Cont'd
    1D-(1S)-X -(P);
    2C-(P )-2S-(X);
    P -(P )-XX!

        !: This sort of balancing XX is simply a repeat of the original cue bid

    (1D)-P-(1S)-??

        1N: Natural, strong notrump, even in the sandwich position

    (1D)-1S-(P)-??

        1N: Natural, around 7-10
        2C: Constructive, non-forcing
        2D: Transfer to hearts, might or might not be weak
        2H: Invitaional spade raise
        2S: Normal raise
        2N: Natural invite
        3C: Natural, game-forcing

    Cont'd
    (1D)-1S-(P)-2C;
    (P )-??

        2S: Doesn't necessarily show extra strength, definitely shows a sixth spade

    

    P -(1D)-2C-(X);
    ??
        XX: Lead-directional showing a club honor

    1H-(1N)-??

    X : Penalty, puts partnership in a force, follow-doubles are penalties. However, if you follow by bidding a suit, that is non-forcing.
    2C: 2-suiter, clubs and either diamonds or spades
    2D: 2-suiter, diamonds and spades
    2H: To play
    2S: To play

    (1H)-2D-(4H)-P;
    (P )-??

        X : Takeout, in your style you would always start with a takeout double rather than a 2D overcall if you had 4 spades, so partner will not be playing you for a 4 card spade holding
        4N: Takeout for the minors

    1S-(2D)-??
        
        X : Followed by a spade raise would be assumed to show doubleton honor, though a soft 3-card limit raise with interest in other strains is possible
        3D: Limit raise or better

         P -(P  )-1S;
    (2H)-2S-(2N!)-??
        !: Relay to 3C, likely a weak heart raise

        X : Maximum with defensive orientation
        3C: Natural game try
        3S: Not invitational

    (P)-1S-(2S!)-??
        !: Hearts and clubs

        X : Interest in defending, likely not spade support
        2N: Natural, invitational (when enemy suits are known)
        3S: To play, no game interest
        3H: Limit raise or better, puts you in a force unless you get a chance to clarify you only have a limit raise
        4H: Splinter, slam interest in spades
        4S: Any hand, partner must pass. Does not create a force
            If the next hand bids, partner may not bid 5S on his own
            If he wishes to bid 5S he doubles -> penalty double not available

    Cont'd
    (P )-1S -(2S!)-3H;
    (5H)-5S!
        !: Weaker than pass (forcing) followed by a pull

    1N!-(2C@)-??
        !: 10-12
        @: Majors

        P: Pass followed by double shows a good hand with a 3-card holding in their suit. 
           Partner is expected to pull if he has only a doubleton.
        X: Shows a good hand, creating a force. 
           It would show the ability to double at least one of the majors, and invite partner to double. 
           Following doubles by either partner are penalties, showing a 4-card holding in their suit.
        2D: To play
        2H: Inv+ in clubs
        2S: Inv+ in diamonds
        2N: Natural invite

    1N!-(2D@)-2N#
        !: 14-16
        @: Diamonds and a major

        #: 2N is Lebensohl, likely a long club suit and no game interest, 3C would be a natural game force

    (P )-1N!-(2H@)-2S;
    (3H)-3S -(4H )-??
        !: 14-16
        @: 5 card heart suit and a minor

        2S is to play

    (1N!)-P-(2C)-??
        !: 12-14

        X: Lead-directing, even vs. a weak notrump

    （1N)-??

        X : 4 card major and a longer minor
        2C: Majors
        2D: 1 major
        2H: 5 card suit and a minor
        2S: 5 card suit and a minor
        2N: Both minors        

    2D-(X!)-??
        !: Either a takeout double of spades or some strong hand
        
        P : If 4th seat bids, partner shuts up. 
           If 4th seat passes, partner passes (ending the auction) if he holds 3+ diamonds but he shows his suit with fewer than 3 diamonds. 
           On hands with 4+ diamonds and short in a major this will often avoid going for a number since 4th seat needs a diamond stack to pass.
        XX: Forces partner to bid 2H, after which you place the contract. This allows you to stop in 2H when you have a long heart suit.
        2H: Pass or correct
        2S: Pass or correct
        2N: Asking about partner's hand. At least game-invitational.
        3C: Shows hearts, asks about heart length. At least game invitational.
        3D: Shows spades, asks about spade length. At least game invitational.
        3H: Pass or correct
        3S: Pass or correct
        3N: End of auction
        4C: Asks partner to transfer to his suit.
        4D: Asks partner to bid his suit.
        4H: End of auction
        4S: End of auction
        
    After opponent overcalls over a strong 1C, responder's jump to a suit show a long suit but less than a positive response.

## Modules

    RKC(03/14)
    We always use the cheapest artificial call above 4 of the trump suit for our RKC call.
    4T+1 always being RKC for T provided 4T+1 isn't needed as natural.
    5T+1 being the king ask.

    E.g.
    4S RKC, follow-ups other than 5H/6H signoff
        5C: Ask for queen of trumps
        5D: Ask for queen of trumps
        5S: Ask for specific kings
            5S does not promise all keycards, if responder wants to bid grand slam, he bids 6N
            Partner shows kings up the line, showing the lowest king
                Make a bid corresponding to a higher king asks partner to bid 6N if holding that king
        5N: Pick a slam
        6C: Natural offer to play
        6D: Natural offer to play

    Transfer Advances

    E.g.
        P-(1S)-2H;
    (P)-??

        3C: Transfer to diamonds
        3D: Invitational heart raise
        3H: Non-invitational

    Two Card X
    You play this 2-card double when the following conditions are satisfied:
        1) Opponents have bid at the 2-level
        2) Both you and your partner have done something other than pass (but did not open or overcall 1N)
        3) You are not in a force
        4) The double doesn't have another pre-defined meaning (such as support double)
    It shows exactly two cards in opponents' trumps and interest in competing.

    E.g.
        (P )-1D-(X)-1H;
        (P )-1S-(P)-P ;
        (2H)-??
            X: Two Card X
                2N: Asking for your better minor if he wants to play 3 of a minor but doesn't know which minor.
    
             1D-(P)-1H;
        (2D)-??
            X: Support double

        Cont'd
            1D-(P)-1H;
        (2D)-P-(P)-??
            X : Shows exactly a doubleton diamond and interest in competeing(could have 3 diamonds and thik it is the best action). Definitely not a singleton diamond.
            2H: To play, no game interest
            2S: Assumed natural, game-forcing
            2N: Takeout, asking for better minor
            3C: To play
            3D: Some kind of game force
            3N: Natural invite

    E.g.
         1S-(P)-1N-(2H);
        -??
            X : Two card X
                2N: Takeout
            2S: Normal, 6-card spade suit
            2N: Relay to 3C, showing a weak 3 of a minor call
            3C: 5-5 maximum

    E.g.
        1H-(P)-2H-(2S)
            X of 2S by both opener and responder would be 2-card.

    Opps 2S Balancing Module
    E.g.
        (1N)-P-(2H)-??
        X: Primarily lead-directing

        (1N)-P-(2H)-P ;
        (2S)-P-(P )-??
            X: a) 3-suited
            b) Hearts and clubs
            c) Red suits, longer diamonds
            Follow up:
                2N: Asks if you have diamonds, 
                    if you do you bid 3D
                    else if you have h+c, you bid 3C

    3-level Responsive Alternative
    We use this treatment all the time at the 3-level, when partner has opened the bidding overcalled, or made a takeout double, and the next hand bids 3C, 3D, or 3H
    E.g.
    (2C!)-2S-(3C)-??
        !: Precision

        X : Relay to next cheapest suit, assumed to be weak somewhere
            But followed by cue bid or 3N shows regular responsive
        3D: Natural and forcing
        3H: Natural and forcing
        3S: Limit raise
        4C: Slam interest, shows nothing about clubs
        4S: What it sounds like, creates force

    4-level Unspecified Major Cue Bid
    When partner's last call is 3S or 3N and:
        1) Neither minor is a possible trump suit:
            4C: Slam try in hearts
            4D: Slam try in spades
        2) Clubs is a possible trump suit:
            4D: Slam try in unspecific major
                4H : No interest in either major or interest in spades but not hearts
                4S : Interest in hearts but not spades
                4N+: Interest in both majors
        3) Diamonds is a possible trump suit:
            4C: Slam try in unspecific major
                4D: Ask for which major

    Defense Against Multi
        (2D)-??
            X             : 13-15 balanced or some very strong hand
            2N            : 16-18 balanced
            Overcalls     : Natural
            Jump overcalls: Strong

    Defense Against Artificial 2N/3N that Show 1/2 Minors
        (2N!)-??
            !: Minors, not full opening

            3C: Takeout for majors
            3D: Light overcall in a major, pass or correct follow ups
            3H: Sound overcall
            3S: Sound overcall

    High-level Artificial Call Gets Doubled
    With no first or second round control in the doubled strain, next hand passes.
    If the person making the artificial call is still interested he redoubles.
    If the person making the artificial call also has no control, he can hit the brakes and place the contract.
    If the partner of the artificial bidder has a first or second round control of the suit, he simply makes the same bid he would have made had there been no double.
    Direct redouble shows no control but the queen of the suit.

    E.g.
    2C -(P )-2D-(P);
    3N -(P )-4D-(X);
    4N!-(5D)-??
        !: 2 keycards, no queen of trumps, diamond control

## Carding

### Meta Rules
    AK leads at the 5-level and higher:
        A: Asks for attitude
        K: Asks for count

#### NT
##### General
    UDCA including discards except for trick 1 where it is standard signals
    Smith echo, high means he likes the opening lead and low means he doesn't
    In middle of hand, T/9 show 0 or 2 higher; other spot card leads are generally attitude
    If giving count, first played card is upside-down count, if not it is standard count

##### Opening Leads
    9 or higher is considered an honor
    A from AK
    Non-partner's suit
        Rusinow(lower of touching honors with more than a doubleton)
        K is power lead 
    Partner's suit
        Standard leads
    Attitude leads for non-honor cards

#### Suit
##### General
    Suit-preference at trick 1
        T/9/8 high side suit
        2/3/4 low side suit
        6/5/7 encouraging
        J     special card which says that partner doesn't have the spot card for the signal
        Make least damaging signal if no suitable card
    UDCA
    Standard current count on later plays in a suit after having given suit-preference
    Standard current count for discard
    Lead of king in the middle of the hand asks for upside-down count
    Splitting honors show 0 or 2 higher

##### Opening Leads
    Your agreements are that from AK you may lead either the ace or the king. 
        You lead the ace when you want an attitude signal. 
        You lead the king when you want a suit-preference signal.
    Standard honor leads for non-AK.
    Interior sequence
        2nd from interior sequence with 3, 4, or 6-card suit.
        Top of interior with 5-card suit.
    Third from even, smallest from odd, top of a doubleton
    5th best from 7 card suit if there is known length
    From 3 small, high or low, when in doubt - count
