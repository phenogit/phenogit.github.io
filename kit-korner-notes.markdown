## Non-Competitive Bidding

### Meta Rules

    My agreements are that in a constructive auction artificial calls above 3N are never choice of strains unless slam is totally out of the question. 

### Bidding Tree

    1C: 16+, artificial
        1D: Artificial, 0-8
            1H: Forcing, 4+h, but with only 4 hearts you would be expected to have longer minor
            1N: 1) 1/2 seat, 17-19, may have 5 card major
                2) 3/4 seat, 18-19
                2C: Asks for 5 card major
                    2D: No 5 card major
                        2H: 4 spades, fewer than 4 hearts, at least game invitational
                            2S: Minimum, usually 4 spades but possibly 3 spades preferring to play 4-3 fit if partner is invitational
                            2N: Minimum, fewer than 4 spades
                            3C: Non-minimum, fewer than 4 spades, says nothing about clubs
                                3D: Shortness in the other major, not 4-4 in minors(4-4-4-1 hands are handled differently)
                                    3H: Ask about minor length

## Competitive Bidding
### Meta Rules
    General agreements are that 2N in competition is always takeout unless specifically defined otherwise.
    
    Your agreements regarding pass and redouble after an artificial call such as 2NT is doubled is that pass is an offer to play while redouble is never business -- partner may not pass.

    E.g.
        1N!-(2C@)-P-(2D#);
        2N -(X  )
            !: 10-12
            @: Majors
            #: Asking for better major

    Transfer Response Over X of 1D Opener
    1D-(X)-??
        XX: Shows hearts
        1H: Shows spades
        
        If fourth seat bids something, opener makes a support double with 3-card support, raises with 4-card support. 
        If fourth seat passes, opener bids 1 of responder's suit with 3-card support, with other bids meaning the same as if responder had bid 1 of his major. 
        In particular, 2 of responder's major doesn't show anything except 4-card support.

    Cont'd
    1D-(X)-1H-(P);
   -??
        1S: Show 3-card spade support. 
        Other bids are exactly as if partner had bid a natural 1♠.

    Forcing pass doesn't show extra strength.
    All it shows is more of an offensive orentation.

    Voluntarily and non-premptively jumps to game creates a force.

    Passing lead directing double of 3N shows at least partial stopper.
    XX shows no stopper.
    Avoids running on his own.

    E.g.
          1D-(P)-2N;
      (P)-3N-(X)-??
        P : Partial stopper or better
        XX: No stopper

    Cont'd
            1D-(P)-2N;
        (P)-3N-(X)-P ;
        (P)-??
            XX: Shows not even a partial stopper

    Pass/X Inversion
        Applies when the following conditions are satisfied:
            1) We have opened 1C
            2) We are in a force
            3) Opponents are at the 4 level or higher
        Only one pass/X inversion per auction
    E.g.
        1C-(P)-2C -(2H);
        2S-(P)-4C-(4D);
       -??
            X : Optional, like a normal forcing pass.
            P : This requests partner to double unless he has a hand which would not have sat a penalty double. 
               If you aren't planning on passing the double, you have various possible followups depending on the logic of the auction.
               X:
                4S: Offer to play, but not as strong as an immediate 4S call.
                5C: Slam try.
            4H: RKC for clubs. 
                Normal responses (even though responder is known to have AK of trumps he still counts them in his response). However, since he is known to have the queen of trumps, he doesn't show that as a queen. 
                Instead, he calls the jack of trumps the queen. This way you can determine whether the suit is truly solid.
            4S: To play
            4N: Slam try in clubs. Says nothing about controls.
                (5D)-?
                    P: Normal forcing pass
            5C: To play, no slam interest

    Penalty X of 1N puts partnership in force
    Ｅ.g.
        1D-(1N)-X
        follow up
            1D-(1N)-X-2S;
            ??
                X : Penalty
                2N: Both minors, diamond emphasis
                    Possibly both red suits with longer diamond, he pulls 3C to 3D
                3C: Both minors, club emphasis

            1D-(1N)-X-2S;
            P -(P ) -??
                    X : Penalty
                        * Partner pulls to 2N is probably 3 suited takeout
                    2N: Takeout, asking for better minor
                    3C: Natural, non-forcing
                    3D: Natural, non-forcing
                    3H: Natural, non-forcing

    A non-jump to 2N in competition is never natural. 
    If game is logically possible, 2N is a relay to 3C assumed to show a weak hand somewhere, while 3-level calls (including a raise) are stronger. 
    If game is not logically possible, 2N is takeout presumably for the minors, and 3-level bids are just competitive.

    Pass of a redouble of a takeout double is always penalties, unless both of the following conditions are met:
        1) The opponents are at the 1-level.
        2) The partner of the doubler is in front of the suit doubled.
    Ｅ.g.
        a. (1S)-X-(XX)-Pass is non-committal. 
        b. (1S)-P-(P )-X;
           (XX)-Pass is penalties. 
        c. (1S)-(P)-(2S)-P;
           (P)- (P)-(XX)-Pass is penalties.

    CRASH over strong club. 
    The crash bids are X, 1D, and 1N. 1NT would show pointed or rounded suits. Other calls are natural.
        (1C)-??
            X : Color
            1D: Rank
            1N: Shape

### Misc

    P -(1D)-2C-(X);
    ??
        XX: Lead-directional showing a club honor

    Transfer advances opposite overcalls

        !: 10-12
        @: Diamonds and a major
        
        4D: Transfer

    1N!-(2C@)-??
        !: 10-12
        @: Majors

        P: Pass followed by double shows a good hand with a 3-card holding in their suit. 
           Partner is expected to pull if he has only a doubleton.
        X: Shows a good hand, creating a force. 
           It would show the ability to double at least one of the majors, and invite partner to double. 
           Following doubles by either partner are penalties, showing a 4-card holding in their suit.
        2D: To play
        2H: Inv+ in clubs
        2S: Inv+ in diamonds
        2N: Natural invite
        3D: To play

    (P)-1S-(2S!)-??
        !: Hearts and clubs

        X : Interest in defending, likely not spade support
        2N: Natural, invitational (when enemy suits are known)
        3S: To play, no game interest
        3H: Limit raise or better, puts you in a force unless you get a chance to clarify you only have a limit raise
        4H: Splinter, slam interest in spades
        4S: Any hand, partner must pass. Does not create a force
            If the next hand bids, partner may not bid 5S on his own
            If he wishes to bid 5S he doubles -> penalty double not available

    Cont'd
    (P )-1S -(2S!)-3H;
    (5H)-5S!
        !: Weaker than pass (forcing) followed by a pull

    2D-(X!)-??
        !: Either a takeout double of spades or some strong hand
        
        P : If 4th seat bids, partner shuts up. 
           If 4th seat passes, partner passes (ending the auction) if he holds 3+ diamonds but he shows his suit with fewer than 3 diamonds. 
           On hands with 4+ diamonds and short in a major this will often avoid going for a number since 4th seat needs a diamond stack to pass.
        XX: Forces partner to bid 2H, after which you place the contract. This allows you to stop in 2H when you have a long heart suit.
        2H: Pass or correct
        2S: Pass or correct
        2N: Asking about partner's hand. At least game-invitational.
        3C: Shows hearts, asks about heart length. At least game invitational.
        3D: Shows spades, asks about spade length. At least game invitational.
        3H: Pass or correct
        3S: Pass or correct
        3N: End of auction
        4C: Asks partner to transfer to his suit.
        4D: Asks partner to bid his suit.
        4H: End of auction
        4S: End of auction
        
    After opponent overcalls over a strong 1C, responder's jump to a suit show a long suit but less than a positive response.

## Modules

    RKC(03/14)
    We always use the cheapest artificial call above 4 of the trump suit for our RKC call.

    4S RKC, follow-ups other than 5H/6H signoff
        5C: Ask for queen of trumps
        5D: Ask for queen of trumps
        5S: Ask for specific kings
            5S does not promise all keycards, if responder wants to bid grand slam, he bids 6N
            Partner shows kings up the line, showing the lowest king
                Make a bid corresponding to a higher king asks partner to bid 6N if holding that king
        5N: Pick a slam
        6C: Natural offer to play
        6D: Natural offer to play

    Two Card X
    You play this 2-card double when the following conditions are satisfied:
        1) Opponents have bid at the 2-level
        2) Both you and your partner have done something other than pass
        3) You are not in a force
        4) The double doesn't have another pre-defined meaning (such as support double)
    It shows exactly two cards in opponents' trumps and interest in competing.

    E.g.
        (P )-1D-(X)-1H;
        (P )-1S-(P)-P ;
        (2H)-??
            X: Two Card X
                2N: Asking for your better minor if he wants to play 3 of a minor but doesn't know which minor.

    Opps 2S Balancing Module
    E.g.
        (1N)-P-(2H)-??
        X: Primarily lead-directing

        (1N)-P-(2H)-P ;
        (2S)-P-(P )-??
            X: a) 3-suited
            b) Hearts and clubs
            c) Red suits, longer diamonds
            Follow up:
                2N: Asks if you have diamonds, 
                    if you do you bid 3D
                    else if you have h+c, you bid 3C

    3-level Responsive Alternative
    We use this treatment all the time at the 3-level, when partner has opened the bidding overcalled, or made a takeout double, and the next hand bids 3C, 3D, or 3H
    E.g.

#### NT
##### General
    UDCA including discards except for trick 1 where it is standard signals
    Smith echo
    In middle of hand, T/9 show 0 or 2 higher; other spot card leads are generally attitude
    If giving count, first played card is upside-down count, if not it is standard count

##### Opening Leads
    9 or higher is considered an honor
    A from AK
    Non-partner's suit
        Rusinow(lower of touching honors with more than a doubleton)
        K is power lead 
    Partner's suit
        Standard leads
    Attitude leads for small card

#### Suit
##### General
    Suit-preference at trick 1
        T/9/8 high side suit
        2/3/4 low side suit
        6/5/7 encouraging
        Make least damaging signal if no suitable card
    UDCA
    Standard current count on later plays in a suit
    Standard current count for discard
    Splitting honors show 0 or 2 higher

##### Opening Leads
    Third from even, smallest from odd, top of a doubleton

    Your agreements are that from AK you may lead either the ace or the king. 
        You lead the ace when you want an attitude signal. 
        You lead the king when you want a suit-preference signal.
